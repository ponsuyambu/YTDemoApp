# YTDemo App
YouTube API demo app for code challenge for Mobilelive, canada.

## Screens
### 1. Authentication screen
The application offers user Google sign in. Using Google SignIn, the user can sign-in to the app and proceed to the main screen.
### 2. User's Playlist screen

## Notes:
- To build the release variant of the app locally(for the reviewer), release keystore is stored in git. Keystore has to be kept safely in other secure place or else app siging by Goolge play can be used.
